# doft
## *Daniel's Own Formatting Type*

***

### What is it?

> For the time being it's just a JSON parser written in C, with aims for becoming its very own file format type

To-do's:

- [X] Change name of the whole thing from 'json' to 'doft'

- [X] Check that files have the correct extension type (.doft)

- [ ] Change the whole brace-bracket syntax

- [ ] License w/ MIT

- [ ] Pack it into a Python library

### Install & Use

> To install it, simply download the repo and run the `make install` command

```
git clone https://github.com/danibt656/doft
cd doft
make install
```

There's a `main.c` file in the `src/` folder. There it lays an example on how to use the parser & iterator, and obtain the contents of the file with a sort-of Object Relational Mapping (ORM).

### Why make your own FT?

> There's no meaning behind it, more than learning more about lexing & parsing in C. Then I thought it would be fun to tweak its syntax to my personal liking

*By the way, thanks for checking it out ;-)*
